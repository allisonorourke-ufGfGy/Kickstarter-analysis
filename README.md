# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
#### The purpose of this experiment is to help a prospective client by analyzing trends from Kickstarter data to understand different variables that might affect the success of her project.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### I first began this analysis by looking at the different outcomes of Kickstarters based on the month that they were launched in. I broke it down to look at campaigns based on their status as 'successful', 'failed', or 'canceled'. I then looked at the month which the campaign was started. I did this through a pivot table which had parent category and years in the filter, outcomes in columns, date created conversion in rows, and count of outcomes in the values. When I created a graph, as seen below, I was able to see that May ans June were the most successful months to launch a campaign because they had the highest count of 'successful' campaigns. The number of 'failed' plays was pretty consistent throughout with May and October having slightly higher rates of those campaigns.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
